Assignment 3: Design and Implementation of an Interactive Story


Instructions:

For this assignment you are required to create an interactive story using one of the following three applications:

Twine
Fungus for Unity
Ink
While you are free to create whatever type of story you wish (with of course the usual restrictions on offensive materials) the following are some of the elements I will expect to see in your submission:

Variables: setting and using to control logic and flow of events and narrative delivery
Meaningful Choices:  If choices are offered at least some of them should be meaningful and the decisions made should influence events of story
Story Structure: Attempts to make use of dramatic structures (3 act, etc.) and the various other narrative\story devices discussed in lectures
Characters: Usage of characters (NPCs) to help guide/motivate/thwart the player
Branching Storyline: Hand in hand with meaningful choices I want to see branching storylines reflecting effects of choices made
Language: Care taken with spelling, grammar and descriptive prose
Theming: Use of appropriate images, audio, narrative to create an overarching aesthetic
Your focus should be on creating a cohesive and well designed overall experience, i.e. don't just add in characters and/or events without considering their role, for example:

A well developed companion or guide that helps player, when needed
An antagonist designed to thwart the player every step of the way
An event that forces the player to make a difficult decision
Submission:

Please take careful note that I will expect the following items to be included as part of your submission:

A link to a zip with all source materials (source code, design materials such as graphics (video and images) and audio. Please feel free to also include associated design materials (character design ideas, character sheets, descriptions of motivation including certain design artifacts (e.g. maybe you wanted the player to feel a sense of "unease" so you included particular audio\video elements and increased the pace of narrative (via timed events perhaps)
Please make sure to also include a playable version (exe, html, etc.) in the zip. This will be dependant on the application you choose to use to produce the interactive story.
Please make sure that the zip (zip and not rar or other formats!) has been tested and is not corrupt
